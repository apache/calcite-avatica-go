## Issues

To file issues, please use the [Calcite JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/CALCITE/issues) and select `avatica-go`
as the component.

## Updating protobuf definitions
1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. From the root of the repository, run `docker-compose run compile-protobuf`

## Live reload during development
It is possible to reload the code in real-time during development. This executes the test suite every time a `.go` or
`.mod` file is updated. The test suite takes a while to run, so the tests will not complete instantly, but live-reloading
during development allows us to not have to manually execute the test suite on save.

### Set up
1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. From the root of the repository, run `docker-compose run dev`.

3. After terminating the container, stop all the containers and remove them using: `docker-compose down`

## Testing
The test suite takes around 4 minutes to run if you run both the Avatica HSQLDB and Apache Phoenix tests.

### Easy way
1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. From the root of the repository, run `docker-compose run test`.

3. After the tests complete, stop all the containers and remove them using: `docker-compose down`

### Manual set up
1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

For Go 1.10 and below, install the dependencies (skip these steps if using Go 1.11 and above):
1a. Install [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep): `go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`

1b. Install dependencies by running `dep ensure -v` from the root of the repository.

2. The test suite requires access to an instance of Avatica running HSQLDB and an instance of Apache Phoenix running the
Phoenix Query Server.

You should then set the `HSQLDB_HOST` and `PHOENIX_HOST` environment variables. For example:
{% highlight shell %}
HSQLDB_HOST: http://hsqldb:8765
PHOENIX_HOST: http://phoenix:8765
{% endhighlight %}

3. To select the test suite, export `AVATICA_FLAVOR=HSQLDB` for Avatica HSQLDB or `AVATICA_FLAVOR=PHOENIX` for Phoenix.

4. Then run `go test -v ./...` from the root of the repository to execute the test suite.

## Releasing

### Preparing for release
1. You will need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

2. If you have not set up a GPG signing key, set one up by following these [instructions](https://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#generate-key).

3. If this release is a new major version (we are releasing 4.0.0 vs the current version 3.0.0), update the version in the
import path in `go.mod`. The import paths in the various sample code snippets should also be updated.

4. Since we need to support Go modules, tags must be prefixed with a `v`. For example, tag as `v3.1.0` rather than `3.1.0`.

5. Check that `NOTICE` has the current copyright year.

### Perform a dry-run
* The script expects you to mount your `~/.gnupg` directory into the `/.gnupg` directory in the container. Once mounted into the container,
the script will make a copy of the contents and move it to a different location, so that it will not modify the contents of your original
`~/.gnupg` directory during the build.

{% highlight bash %}
# On Linux:
docker-compose run -v ~/.gnupg:/.gnupg dry-run

# On Windows
docker-compose run -v /c/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/gnupg:/.gnupg dry-run
{% endhighlight %}

### Build the release
{% highlight bash %}
# On Linux:
docker-compose run -v ~/.gnupg:/.gnupg release

# On Windows
docker-compose run -v /c/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/gnupg:/.gnupg release
{% endhighlight %}

If the build fails, perform a clean:
1. Remove the git tag locally and remotely:
{% highlight bash %}
git tag -d vX.Y.Z-rcA
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z-rcA
{% endhighlight %}

2. Clean the local repository
{% highlight bash %}
docker-compose run clean
{% endhighlight %}

### Check the release before uploading
The name of the release folder must be in the following format: `apache-calcite-avatica-go-X.Y.Z-rcN`. The version must 
include release candidate identifiers such as `-rc0`, if they are present.

The files inside the release folder must have any release candidate identifiers such as `-rc1` removed, even if the
release is a release candidate. `src` must also be added to the filename.

For example, if we are uploading the `apache-calcite-avatica-go-3.0.0-rc1` folder, the files must be named 
`apache-calcite-avatica-go-3.0.0-src.tar.gz`. Note the inclusion of `src` in the filename.

The tar.gz must be named `apache-calcite-avatica-go-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz`. 

There must be a GPG signature for the tar.gz named: `apache-calcite-avatica-go-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.asc`

There must be a SHA256 hash for the tar.gz named: `apache-calcite-avatica-go-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.sha512`

### Uploading release artifacts to dev for voting
#### Manually
`svn` must be installed in order to upload release artifacts.

1. Check out the Calcite dev release subdirectory: `svn co "https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/calcite/" calcite-dev`.

2. Move the release folder under `dist/` into the `calcite-dev` folder.

3. Add the new release to the svn repository: `svn add apache-calcite-avatica-go-X.Y.Z-rcN`. Remember to change the folder name to the
correct release in the command.

4. Commit to upload the artifacts: `svn commit -m "apache-calcite-avatica-go-X.Y.Z-rcN" --username yourapacheusername --force-log`
Note the use of `--force-log` to suppress the svn warning, because the commit message is the same as the name of the directory.

#### Using docker
This assumes that a release was built and the artifacts are in the `dist/` folder.

{% highlight bash %}
docker-compose run publish-release-for-voting
{% endhighlight %}

The script will also generate a vote email to send to the dev list. You can use this email, but make sure to check that
all the details are correct.

### Send an email to the Dev list for voting:

Send out the email for voting:

### Promoting a release after voting
#### Manually
`svn` must be installed in order to upload release artifacts.

NOTE: Only official releases that has passed a vote may be uploaded to the release directory.

1. Check out the Calcite release directory: `svn co "https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/calcite/" calcite-release`.

2. Copy the release into the `calcite-release` folder. Remember to check the name of the release's folder to ensure that it is in
the correct format.

3. Add the release to the svn repository: `svn add apache-calcite-avatica-go-X.Y.Z`. Remember to change the folder name to the
correct release in the command.

4. Commit to upload the artifacts: `svn commit -m "Release apache-calcite-avatica-go-X.Y.Z" --username yourapacheusername`.

5. Tag the final release in git and push it:

{% highlight bash %}
git tag vX.Y.Z X.Y.Z-rcN
git push origin vX.Y.Z
{% endhighlight %}

#### Using docker
This assumes that a rc release was tagged and pushed to the git repository.

{% highlight bash %}
docker-compose run promote-release
{% endhighlight %}

### Announce the release
After 24 hours, announce the release by sending an announcement to the [dev list](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/calcite-dev/)
and [announce@apache.org](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-announce/).

An example of the announcement could look like:
{% highlight text %}
Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache Calcite Avatica Go X.Y.Z released
To: dev@calcite.apache.org

The Apache Calcite team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Calcite Avatica Go X.Y.Z.

Avatica is a framework for building database drivers. Avatica
defines a wire API and serialization mechanism for clients to
communicate with a server as a proxy to a database. The reference
Avatica client and server are implemented in Java and communicate
over HTTP. Avatica is a sub-project of Apache Calcite.

The Avatica Go client is a Go database/sql driver that enables Go
programs to communicate with the Avatica server.

Apache Calcite Avatica Go X.Y.Z is a minor release of Avatica Go
with fixes to the import paths after enabling support for Go modules.

This release includes updated dependencies, testing against more
targets and support for Go Modules as described in the release notes:

    https://calcite.apache.org/avatica/docs/go_history.html#vX-Y-Z

The release is available here:

    https://calcite.apache.org/avatica/downloads/avatica-go.html

We welcome your help and feedback. For more information on how to
